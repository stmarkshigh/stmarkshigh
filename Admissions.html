                        For our excellent grade 7 students to apply for a space in one of our day or bording
                        spaces, they are requested to bring their grade 7 results to the school and submit them
                        to the Sincobile Hall where you shall find our dedicated staff of Deputies and Head of Departments
                        who shall make a decision based on the academic performance of the child.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        This normally happens during the first to second week of January. So if you miss this slot your application
                        will not be considered.

                    By the the time our student have reached High School, they will be fully equipped with the knowledge and

                    is all thanks to the fact that our students are exposed to all the different subjects in different faculties of work, 
                    which enables them to eventually choose what they are interested in and what subjects must be chosen for that particular 
                    career.

                        Please note that students can only sit for the subjects they want to do for the AS & A level course. If students are accepted
                        into the program, they will need to do a minimum of 4 subjects for the <b>AS level</b> of their studies. For those students 
                        who will choose to do the full 2 year course, they will be required to do a minimum of 3 science's to complete the <b>A Level</b> course.
