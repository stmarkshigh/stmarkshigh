        <h1><u> History </u></h1>
        <p>St Marks High School, coeducational institution, founded in 1908, but fully established in <br>
            1910 by Rev.Bishop Chistopher Charles Watts. In August 2010 the school celebrated a Centenary(100 years)<br>
            of existence. St.Marks was originally a school for European pupils only under the St.marks Association and <br>
            the Anglican Mission Church. The school was handed over to the Education Department of the Eswatini Government <br>
            around 1956 by the St.Marks Association, and from that date on till today it became a Multiracial and/or truly international<br>
            institution. Today St.Marks student population is predominately Swazis and few other races/ nationalities. The school also provides A-level which is a bridging 
            course for students who wish to join universities where the IGCSE/EGCSE qualification is not sufficient enough for admission.
            The school started offering A'Level in 1976. This was necessitated by the fact that the University of Swaziland was not offering any of the science related courses like Engineering/ Medicine at that time. 
            A student who desired to persue Medicine, for example, had to first do BSc before applying to universities outside Swaziland.
            The syllabus the school is offering is the Cambridge International Advanced Level Syllabus. This is one of the most recognized university entry qualifications worldwide. The setting and marking of examinations is done in the UK alternative.

            <h1><u>Boarders and Day Schoolars!</u></h1>
                <p> Boarding school offers students an experience unlike any other: to immerse themselves in their education, grow within a supportive and diverse community,
                    and position themselves for success after school. Statistics show that boaders feel more prepared for life after graduation,and more likely to earn advanced degrees,
                     and rate their school experience as very satisfactory. St.Marks is one of the few schools in the city that promotes the boarding school system, and with that in mind, 
                    it can also accomodates international students and domestic students who live far from the institution. In a boarding school setting, you live, play, study, and socialize among your peers.
                     A diverse boarding school setting with students from different backgrounds offers a special opportunity for growth and learning. Students can expand their perspectives and horizons as they learn together both in and out of the classroom.
                     Safefy is also the school's main priority, not only for borders but also for day-schoolars. Campus-life of day-schoolars is also a blust! Every facility is within close proximity (it's a bearable distance to walk when switching 
                     periods!). Even the school's infrastruction is condusive for productive and active-learning.

                    <p> Students at St.Marks are in possession to numerous number of operative facilities. One of those is the <b>Library!</b> The library offers a wide variety of interesting books (depending on your interests) which includes: fiction, sci-fi, science, documentaries 
                    , history , commercials etc. This free space also promotes group discussions and independent-study, and it also offer students access to the internet. Students can also borrow books to expand their horizons and knowledge outside the structured curriculums through reading, and they don't need library IDs for that!
